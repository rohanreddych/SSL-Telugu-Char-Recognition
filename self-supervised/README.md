- the idea is to train a generative pretext neural network and then use that as pretrained model for telugu OCR
- the pretext task would be given a character (which we can obtain using normal algorithms and without any manual tasks) the network tries to generate it.
- possibly using an autoencoder or GAN type architecture.
